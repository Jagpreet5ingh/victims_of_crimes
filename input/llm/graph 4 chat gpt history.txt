ChatGPT
Certainly! To create a line graph with age groups instead of sex, representing the total number of crimes against each age group each year, you can modify the code as follows:

R
Copy code
# Assuming the column AGE_GROUP exists in your dataset
age_counts <- aggregate(COUNT_ ~ REPORT_YEAR + AGE_GROUP, data = crime_data, sum)

# Create a line graph using ggplot2 with age_group on the x-axis
ggplot(age_counts, aes(x = as.factor(REPORT_YEAR), y = COUNT_, color = AGE_GROUP, group = AGE_GROUP)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Total count of crimes against each age group per year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Number of Crimes") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(age_counts$COUNT_), by = 2000)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("18-24" = "blue", "25-34" = "red", "35-44" = "green", "45-54" = "purple", "55+" = "orange"),
                     labels = c("18-24" = "18-24", "25-34" = "25-34", "35-44" = "35-44", "45-54" = "45-54", "55+" = "55+")) +  # Specify colors and labels
  theme_minimal()
Make sure to replace "AGE_GROUP" with the actual column name representing age groups in your dataset. Additionally, adjust the color values and labels in scale_color_manual according to your preference and the unique values in your age group column.

the age_group has four categories : Youth, Child, Adult, Unknown
ChatGPT
Great! If your AGE_GROUP column has four categories: "Youth," "Child," "Adult," and "Unknown," you can modify the code as follows:

R
Copy code
# Assuming the column AGE_GROUP exists in your dataset
age_counts <- aggregate(COUNT_ ~ REPORT_YEAR + AGE_GROUP, data = crime_data, sum)

# Create a line graph using ggplot2 with age_group on the x-axis
ggplot(age_counts, aes(x = as.factor(REPORT_YEAR), y = COUNT_, color = AGE_GROUP, group = AGE_GROUP)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Total count of crimes against each age group per year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Number of Crimes") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(age_counts$COUNT_), by = 2000)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Youth" = "blue", "Child" = "red", "Adult" = "green", "Unknown" = "purple"),
                     labels = c("Youth" = "Youth", "Child" = "Child", "Adult" = "Adult", "Unknown" = "Unknown")) +  # Specify colors and labels
  theme_minimal()
Adjust the column name ("AGE_GROUP") based on the actual column name in your dataset, and adjust the color values and labels in scale_color_manual according to the categories in your age group column.


add another variable to the graph: SEX. Sex have 3 categories Male, Female or Unknown
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can add another variable (SEX) to the graph using facets. Facets will create separate panels for each combination of age group and sex. Here's the modified code:

R
Copy code
# Assuming the columns AGE_GROUP and SEX exist in your dataset
age_sex_counts <- aggregate(COUNT_ ~ REPORT_YEAR + AGE_GROUP + SEX, data = crime_data, sum)

# Create a line graph using ggplot2 with age_group on the x-axis and facets for sex
ggplot(age_sex_counts, aes(x = as.factor(REPORT_YEAR), y = COUNT_, color = SEX, group = interaction(AGE_GROUP, SEX))) +
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Total count of crimes against each age group per year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Number of Crimes") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(age_sex_counts$COUNT_), by = 2000)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male" = "blue", "Female" = "red", "Unknown" = "purple"),
                     labels = c("Male" = "Male", "Female" = "Female", "Unknown" = "Unknown")) +  # Specify colors and labels
  facet_grid(AGE_GROUP ~ ., scales = "free_y", labeller = labeller(AGE_GROUP = label_wrap_gen(width = 10))) +  # Facets for age groups
  theme_minimal()
This code uses facet_grid to create separate panels for each combination of age group and sex. Adjust the column names ("AGE_GROUP" and "SEX") based on the actual column names in your dataset, and adjust the color values and labels in scale_color_manual according to the categories in your sex column.
