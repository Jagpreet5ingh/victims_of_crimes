R Simulated Crime Data
January 22, 2024
Write a simulation in R with 6 columns 
REPORT_YEAR	SUBTYPE	SEX	AGE_GROUP	AGE_COHORT	COUNT_

The Report_Year column should year as the value ranging from 2014-2022. The values can repeat. 
The Subtype column should have one of the following values for each column in report_year: “sexual assault”, “robbery”, “other”, “assault” chosen at random.
The Sex column should have values “M”, “F” or “U” with “U” only having a 10% probability
The Age_Group column should have values “Adult”, “Child”, “Youth”, “Unknown” chosen at random but “Unknown” should only have 10% probability.
The Age_Cohort column should have values as follows:
If Age_Group = “Child”, age_cohort should be “<12”
If Age_Group = “Youth”, age_cohort should be “12-17”
If Age_Group = “Adult”, age_cohort should be one of the following chosen at random “18-24”,”25-34”, “35-44”, “45-54”or “65+”
If Age_Group = “Unknown”, age_cohort should be unknown
The Count column can have any value between 1-2500

Certainly! Below is an R code snippet that creates a simulated dataset based on the criteria you specified:

R
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of rows in the dataset
num_rows <- 1000

# Generate random values for each column
report_year <- sample(2014:2022, num_rows, replace = TRUE)
subtype <- sample(c("sexual assault", "robbery", "other", "assault"), num_rows, replace = TRUE)
sex <- sample(c("M", "F", "U"), num_rows, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.45, 0.45, 0.10))
age_group <- sample(c("Adult", "Child", "Youth", "Unknown"), num_rows, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.40, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10))

# Function to generate age_cohort based on age_group
generate_age_cohort <- function(age_group) {
  if (age_group == "Child") {
    return("<12")
  } else if (age_group == "Youth") {
    return("12-17")
  } else if (age_group == "Adult") {
    return(sample(c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "65+"), 1))
  } else {
    return("Unknown")
  }
}

# Apply the function to generate age_cohort
age_cohort <- sapply(age_group, generate_age_cohort)

# Generate random values for COUNT column
count <- sample(1:2500, num_rows, replace = TRUE)

# Create the data frame
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  REPORT_YEAR = report_year,
  SUBTYPE = subtype,
  SEX = sex,
  AGE_GROUP = age_group,
  AGE_COHORT = age_cohort,
  COUNT_ = count
)

# Display the first few rows of the simulated dataset
head(simulated_data)
This code uses the sample function to randomly select values for each column based on the specified probabilities and conditions. The generate_age_cohort function is used to determine the appropriate values for the AGE_COHORT column based on the AGE_GROUP column. The resulting simulated dataset is stored in the simulated_data data frame.

what packages do i need for this code
ChatGPT
The code I provided doesn't require any additional packages beyond the base R packages. The functions and methods used in the code are part of the base R distribution. Therefore, you can run the code in any standard R environment without installing additional packages.

If you're using RStudio, you can simply copy and paste the code into your R script or console and run it.

Make sure you have R installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official R website: https://cran.r-project.org/

Once you have R installed, you can run the code in the R console or RStudio without any additional package installations.

The Count column can have any value between 1-2500, with only 20% probability that value will be > 300

Certainly! Below is an R code snippet that creates a simulated dataset based on the updated criteria you specified:

R
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of rows in the dataset
num_rows <- 1000

# Generate random values for each column
report_year <- sample(2014:2022, num_rows, replace = TRUE)
subtype <- sample(c("sexual assault", "robbery", "other", "assault"), num_rows, replace = TRUE)
sex <- sample(c("M", "F", "U"), num_rows, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.45, 0.45, 0.10))
age_group <- sample(c("Adult", "Child", "Youth", "Unknown"), num_rows, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.40, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10))

# Function to generate age_cohort based on age_group
generate_age_cohort <- function(age_group) {
  if (age_group == "Child") {
    return("<12")
  } else if (age_group == "Youth") {
    return("12-17")
  } else if (age_group == "Adult") {
    return(sample(c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "65+"), 1))
  } else {
    return("Unknown")
  }
}

# Apply the function to generate age_cohort
age_cohort <- sapply(age_group, generate_age_cohort)

# Generate random values for COUNT column with 20% probability of value > 300
count <- ifelse(runif(num_rows) < 0.2, sample(301:2500, sum(runif(num_rows) < 0.2), replace = TRUE), sample(1:300, num_rows, replace = TRUE))

# Create the data frame
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  REPORT_YEAR = report_year,
  SUBTYPE = subtype,
  SEX = sex,
  AGE_GROUP = age_group,
  AGE_COHORT = age_cohort,
  COUNT_ = count
)

# Display the first few rows of the simulated dataset
head(simulated_data)
In this code, the COUNT_ column is generated with a 20% probability that the value will be greater than 300. This is achieved using the runif function to generate uniform random numbers between 0 and 1. If the generated random number is less than 0.2, then a value greater than 300 is chosen; otherwise, a value between 1 and 300 is chosen.

save output in "Output/Data/simulated_data.csv"
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can use the write.csv function to save the simulated data to a CSV file. Here's the modification to the code to save the output:

R
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of rows in the dataset
num_rows <- 1000

# Generate random values for each column
report_year <- sample(2014:2022, num_rows, replace = TRUE)
subtype <- sample(c("sexual assault", "robbery", "other", "assault"), num_rows, replace = TRUE)
sex <- sample(c("M", "F", "U"), num_rows, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.45, 0.45, 0.10))
age_group <- sample(c("Adult", "Child", "Youth", "Unknown"), num_rows, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.40, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10))

# Function to generate age_cohort based on age_group
generate_age_cohort <- function(age_group) {
  if (age_group == "Child") {
    return("<12")
  } else if (age_group == "Youth") {
    return("12-17")
  } else if (age_group == "Adult") {
    return(sample(c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "65+"), 1))
  } else {
    return("Unknown")
  }
}

# Apply the function to generate age_cohort
age_cohort <- sapply(age_group, generate_age_cohort)

# Generate random values for COUNT column with 20% probability of value > 300
count <- ifelse(runif(num_rows) < 0.2, sample(301:2500, sum(runif(num_rows) < 0.2), replace = TRUE), sample(1:300, num_rows, replace = TRUE))

# Create the data frame
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  REPORT_YEAR = report_year,
  SUBTYPE = subtype,
  SEX = sex,
  AGE_GROUP = age_group,
  AGE_COHORT = age_cohort,
  COUNT_ = count
)

# Save the simulated data to a CSV file
output_path <- "Output/Data/simulated_data.csv"
write.csv(simulated_data, file = output_path, row.names = FALSE)

# Display the first few rows of the simulated dataset
head(simulated_data)
This code will save the simulated data to a CSV file located at "Output/Data/simulated_data.csv".
