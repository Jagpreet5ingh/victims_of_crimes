I want a bar graph with count_ on the y axis, report_year on the x axis and another variable age cohort which have the following options 18 to 24
25 to 34
35 to 44
45 to 54
55 to 64
65+
<12

To create a bar graph with the specified criteria, you can modify your R script as follows:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

# Set working directory
setwd("/cloud/project")

# Read data
crime_data <- read_csv("output/data/edited_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 
column_specifications <- spec(crime_data)

# Aggregate total counts by REPORT_YEAR, AGE_COHORT, and AGE_GROUP
age_counts <- aggregate(COUNT_ ~ REPORT_YEAR + AGE_COHORT + AGE_GROUP, data = crime_data, sum)

# Filter data to include only the specified age cohorts
age_counts <- subset(age_counts, AGE_COHORT %in% c("18 to 24", "25 to 34", "35 to 44", "45 to 54", "55 to 64", "65+", "<12", "Unknown", "12 to 17"))

# Create a bar graph using ggplot2
ggplot(age_counts, aes(x = as.factor(REPORT_YEAR), y = COUNT_, fill = AGE_COHORT)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Number of Crimes",
    fill = "Age Cohort"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(age_counts$COUNT_), by = 2000)) +
  theme_minimal()
This script reads the data, aggregates the total counts by REPORT_YEAR, AGE_COHORT, and AGE_GROUP, filters the data to include only the specified age cohorts, and then creates a bar graph with REPORT_YEAR on the x-axis, COUNT_ on the y-axis, and AGE_COHORT as the fill color.

can i have line graph instead. also exclude: <12

Certainly! Here's the modified script to create a line graph excluding the specified age cohorts:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

# Set working directory
setwd("/cloud/project")

# Read data
crime_data <- read_csv("output/data/edited_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 
column_specifications <- spec(crime_data)

# Aggregate total counts by REPORT_YEAR, AGE_COHORT, and AGE_GROUP
age_counts <- aggregate(COUNT_ ~ REPORT_YEAR + AGE_COHORT + AGE_GROUP, data = crime_data, sum)

# Filter data to exclude specified age cohorts
age_counts <- subset(age_counts, !(AGE_COHORT %in% c("<12", "Unknown", "12 to 17")))

# Create a line graph using ggplot2
ggplot(age_counts, aes(x = as.factor(REPORT_YEAR), y = COUNT_, color = AGE_COHORT, group = AGE_COHORT)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Number of Crimes"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(age_counts$COUNT_), by = 2000)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("18 to 24" = "blue", "25 to 34" = "red", "35 to 44" = "green", 
                                 "45 to 54" = "orange", "55 to 64" = "purple", "65+" = "yellow"),
                     labels = c("18 to 24" = "18-24", "25 to 34" = "25-34", "35 to 44" = "35-44", 
                                "45 to 54" = "45-54", "55 to 64" = "55-64", "65+" = "65+")) +
  theme_minimal()
This script will create a line graph with REPORT_YEAR on the x-axis, COUNT_ on the y-axis, and each age cohort represented by a different colored line. The age cohorts "<12", "Unknown", and "12 to 17" are excluded from the graph.
